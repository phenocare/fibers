# **Are you curious about the health benefit of fibre?** 

Scientists from the [Australian National Phenome Centre](https://www.murdoch.edu.au/research/anpc) at [Murdoch University](https://www.murdoch.edu.au) are currently studying how quickly different types of dietary fibres reach our lower gut and change into compounds that could potentially improve our health.

We invite you to help us learn more about dietary fibres.  This involves attending two-day visits, with at least one week between each visit, at the Harry Perkin Institute in Murdoch.  During these visits, you will have the opportunity to:
-	Receive a personalised session with a dietician who will teach you about dietary fibres and guide you on how much fibre you should eat each day.
-	Attend an education session where you will learn about how fibres improve our health.
-	Enjoy up to three days of the study meals.

## **Can you help The FIBRE Study?**
If you are aged between 18 and 70, you may be eligible to participate in this study.  [Register for the trial here](Register.docx)

## **About the FIBRE Study**
Consuming dietary fibre has the potential to reduce our risk of disease.  Unfortunately, Australians are not eating enough dietary fibre on a daily basis.  

Associate Professor Ruey Leng Loo from the Australian National Phenome Centre is leading this research trial, which aims to investigating different types of fibre and their potential influence our health. 

## **Trial objectives**
-	To find out how quickly different types of fibre travel through our gut
-	To identify the chemical compounds that are produced in our blood, urine, and/or faeces, after eating different dietary fibres.
-	To explore how these chemical compounds can affect our health.

## **Frequently asked questions**

### 1.	What is the study design?
You will eat one of eight different vegetables or fruits in each clinic visit along with a standardised low fibre meal plan.  These meals will be provided as part of the study.  

### 2.	What are the choices of vegetables and fruits? 
You can choose from vegetables that contain fibre known to be beneficial for your gut health.  These vegetables include yacon, Jerusalem artichoke, globe artichoke, and elephant garlic.   We also have fruits that contain different types of fibres, including apple, watermelon, orange and tomato.  You can choose more than one.  

### 3.	What is a low fibre meal, and do I have to prepare them? 
The low fibre meal plan consists of toasts with butter for breakfast, a roast chicken sandwich for lunch, and roast chicken and potatoes for dinner.  If you are vegetarian, we will substitute meat with egg and chess.  All the food will be provided to you, and you will not need to prepare it. 

### 4.	What does it involve?
You will need to attend two clinic visits.  

During the first visit (screening visit), we will check your eligible by having you consume a small amount of inulin powder dissolved in water.  You will undergo an hourly hydrogen breath test by exhaling into a hand-held machine for 8 hours.  This test will determine if you are eligible to participate in the study.  

Twenty-four hours before the second visit (clinic visit), we will ask you to follow a low fibre diet for one day.  The meal will be provided to you.  

On the day of the clinic visit, you will continue with the low fibre diet but have up to three portions of dietary fibres of your choice for breakfast.  Once again, we will perform an hourly hydrogen breath test.  We will also collect urine and blood samples to learn more about what is happening in your body.  A nurse will perform the blood collection during the visit.  If you feel comfortable, you can even provide a stool sample.  

### 5.	When do I have to attend the clinic visit? 
The researcher will arrange a convenient date with you, usually on Monday to Friday.  However, on occasion, we may be able to schedule the clinic on Saturday as well.

### 6.	Is there any reimbursement for my time and travel cost? 
You will receive $1.2 per 10km and the parking fees for the day.  If you use the public transport, we will cover your bus or train fares.  Additionally, you will receive a gift voucher worth $25 for completing the screening visit and an additional $50 for completing the study clinic visit.  

### 7.	Who is funding the study?
The study is supported by [Future Food System Cooperative Research Centre (FFS CRC)]( https://www.futurefoodsystems.com.au/project/bioactive-components-for-value-add-to-australian-artichokes/) and Murdoch University, in collaboration with [Mt Lindesay](ML.docx).
